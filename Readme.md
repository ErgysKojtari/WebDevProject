# Book Catalogue

This Web Development Project is intended to
be a website where users can catalogue books
whether read or to be read. 

Users should be able to rate, review and
bookmark books using easy to use UI.

If possible, users should also be able to 
search for books using parameters such as
Title, Author, Publisher, Publishing Date,
ISBN, etc using an API such as WordCat Search API,
Google Books, Open Library or ISBNdb.
